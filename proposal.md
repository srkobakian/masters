## BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW (Maximum 1,400 words)
### Introductory Statement

Disease data is usually distributed by government organisations as aggregated values for small spatial areas, often defined by political units. A typical approach to plot this data is to make a map with colour representing the numerical value in the spatial area, which is called a choropleth map. The purpose of making the visualisation is to understand the spatial distribution of disease occurrence. When some areas are small and others are large, the reader can get an inaccurate interpretation of the distribution. This research explores ways to better represent the spatial distribution, with a focus on Australian disease mapping. The work is motivated by the Cancer Atlas of Australia.

### Literature Review

choropleth map
cartogram and hexmap
testing effectiveness of type of plot (for accuracy of reading spatial distribution)

*This preliminary review needs to:*
*critically analyse and discuss the key current and seminal relevant literature describe an existing gap in the knowledge derived from the analysis of the literature, and discuss how your thesis will address the gap. The detail required varies between faculties and you should be guided by your supervisors – usually a range of sources, normally between 20-30 is required. You should ensure that at least some of the sources discussed are from the most current literature (1-3 years).*

### Research Problem (e.g. aims, questions and/or hypotheses)

1. Algorithm for hexmapping Australia
2. Testing the effectiveness of the hexmap relative to the choropleth map for providing a more accurate reading of spatial distribution for Australia.
3. Communicating the relationship between the hexmap and choropleth map: animation algorithm


The research problem is to find good practices for visualising geo-spatial and temporal data. The focus on disease data will infer aggregation to grouped data points or populations, these areas may also belong to hierarchies. The aim will be to establish methods that allow more accurate visual inference.
The overarching question may be broken into smaller problems where we will consider separately the visualisations of geospatial disease data, and visualisations of temporal disease data. 

We hypothesise that current visualisation methods for aggregated geospatial data are not efficient for visual inference when the areas are heterogeneous.
We will ask why the visualisation is a good choice to encourage accurate inference of the disease data estimates.


## PROGRAM AND DESIGN OF THE RESEARCH INVESTIGATION (Maximum 2,000 words)


### Objectives, Methodology and Research Plan

This section takes the form of a proposed methodology and research plan, as appropriate to your discipline. 
The descriptions:
should clearly identify the tasks to be undertaken and how these address your research problem;
may be organised in relation to each of the individual aims or questions, and identify specific methods of experimentation for those conducting laboratory based work; 

And should include a clear if preliminary statement of the theoretical/experimental framework underpinning how you are going to carry out the design / plan.

Chap 1: Algorithm for hexmapping Australia

What is your algorithm

Chap 2: Testing the effectiveness of the hexmap relative to the choropleth map

Explain an experimental design that will allow comparison. 

Chap 3: Communicating the relationship between the hexmap and choropleth map: animation algorithm


Theory based on visual inference papers by Mahbubul and Di. We have the opportunity to treat a visualisation as a statistic,visualisation may be compared just as numerical features of models or data summaries can. This is worth doing if methods show statistical distributions are present and not noticed using geographical maps. Results for aggregated areas in disease data are often standardised to be comparable to other areas, and area boundaries are driven by population. In Australia the area size may be irrelevant due to its strong negative correlation with population, therefore we may abstract the resulting rates and argue that cartograms could be applied. 

The research plan should clearly set out your data collection methods and your approach to data analysis. You may list the specific tasks you will be completing when you undertake the research and how you intend to do the tasks and complete your projects. This would normally take the form of a Design of the Study or Strategy statement. The details of the plan will develop as your candidature progresses. It is critical here that you have a clearly articulated idea of what you are attempting to do. Where the research plan and data collection methods are still being developed it is important to provide an indication of the theoretical framework being used to inform consideration of the plan. This research plan may include:
• some methodological options and/or theoretical framework to be considered;
• strategies being followed in order to determine the plan;
• a clear statement of how the development of the research plan is to be progressed.

Chapter 2:
Proposed Design of the Study statement:
Following from visual inference using null plots of skittles.
population and sampling: visual inference by Amazon mechanical Turk users, selection procedure?;
Data collection: Survey distributed through Amazon mechanical Turk, 
Variables will include the map type, spatial distribution, participant id, their identification of a spatial distribution;
Data analysis: data processing and analyzing will include consider the amount of correct answers by individual participants, consider the amount of correct answers for each map type and spatial distribution features, contrast the difference in means for same spatial distribution features presented in different map types;
Laboratory procedures: descriptions of standardized procedures and protocols and new or unique procedures; and
Tools used are Amazon Mechanical Turk, R for statistical analysis and creation of images used in survey



Progession in three stages:
Produce alternative mapping strategies (cartograms informed by Xiaoyue Cheng)
Test effectiveness visual inference (informed by Mabubhul)
Contrast effectiveness of current and alternative methods to provide recommendations


### Resources and Funding Required

Includes a statement on how the method/plan is going to be resourced/funded including any technical support to be provided; and the key equipment required. Examples of requirements to be considered may include, but are not limited to, funding and/or access to:
laboratory equipment and/or specialist facilities
consumables
overseas data collection or experimentation
data sets
specialist software or equipment
specialist services (e.g. transcription or translation, analytical services).

Time of researchers funded by RTP, ACEMS
No laboratory equipment, 
Access to mechanical turk or crowd platform,

### Individual Contribution to the Research Team (where relevant)


### Timeline for Completion of the Program

Your schedule for completing the various aspects of your program needs to be illustrated by a timeline so that you, your supervisors, your faculty and the Research Degrees Committee can see your expected rate of progress. The timeline includes each of the tasks identified in Section 4.1 and should normally include monthly targets. As well as your significant milestones (Annual Progress Report date/s, planned Research Seminar and Expected Lodgement Due Date), it could include your coursework requirements, transferrable skills and other module training as well as proposed conference attendance and field trip travel. Research Degrees Committee will expect to see a proposed eighteen month* (from admission) full time equivalent completion timeline.
Your proposed timeline is to support you in maintaining progress as well as ensuring that your project is realistically scoped within the maximum course completion timeframe. Approaches to creating a timeline are many and varied but this is an important section of your application.
For a simple and generic example that includes details that you should be incorporating into your own timeline please contact your faculty.
*course length is dependent on your entry qualifications and assessment by your faculty as discussed and agreed upon with your supervisory team.
